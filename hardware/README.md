3D objects of the enclosure for both the components and the batteries.
## Overview

circuit_lid.3mf $\rightarrow$ lid to the circuit
standoff_screws.3mf $\rightarrow$ standoff and screws for the lid
standoffs.3mf $\rightarrow$ standoffs for the MT3608 (very small so might need to use a smaller nosell size)
battery_lid.3mf $\rightarrow$ lid to the battery pack
