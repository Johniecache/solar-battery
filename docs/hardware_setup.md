# Hardware Setup Instructions
Hardware needed:
* Soldering Iron
* Insulated Tinned Wire (22 AWG) - for lighter current connections
* Insulated Tinned Wire (16 AWG) - for higher current connections
* Pure (99.9%) Copper Wire (16 AWG) (Optional) - for higher efficiency power connections 
* 21700 50E battery & holder (4S recommended)
* TP4056 Li-ion charging module - for protection
* MT3608 boost converter module 
* Solar Panel (5-6v at minimum 1A)
* Rocker Switch - for power control 
* USB-A female port (with exposed pins or breakout board)
* Kit of Resistors (Optional for voltage dividers for "smart" charger)

Step-by-Step Instructions:
2. Setup your workstation. Ensure all parts needed are at your disposal.
3. Tin (solder) the battery pins on the back of the battery holder and ensure fusion.
4. Cut 2x ~3.5" of 99.9% pure 16 AWG copper wire and straighten it (I used two pliers on each end and pulled taught).
5. Line the straight copper wire to the outside of the pins and trim off any excess length.
6. Reline the cooper wire to the outside and tack solder one of the end pins to the wire.
7. Tack solder the other end.
8. Solder one of the middle pins to the copper wire well and ensure its flush connection.
9. Repeat 4-7 for the other side pins.
10. Using a ruler or some sort if measuring device find the center of the edge of the battery holder between the pin sets and mark it.
11. Cut 2x () 99.9% pure copper wire and straighten it like before.
